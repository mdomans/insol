{"name":"Insol","tagline":"Python - Solr API","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mdomans/insol.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mdomans/insol)\r\n#insol\r\n***\r\n##Python - Solr API\r\n\r\nInsol is a API for [Solr](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/) search engine. It's main features are:\r\n\r\n- ability to start hacking away fast\r\n- object oriented approach to Queries, instead of returning objects and taking string queries, __insol__ uses object oriented query building and returns simple python dicts\r\n\r\nThe core concept of insol is that building properly structured queries is hard while parsing returned values is rather simple. For that problem we need a way to express complex queries as objects.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, __insol__ does not perform any _result-to-object_ evaluation, avoiding unnecessary DB hits. In case you need such mode of operation, it's easy to implement.\r\n\r\n## Instalation\r\n\r\nTo install latest version from PyPI typing:\r\n\r\n`pip install insol`\r\n\r\nis enough.\r\nOr you can install this package (cutting edge version):\r\n`python setup.py install`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo simply try to see what happens or for testing particular queries against your Solr instance:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom insol.shortcuts import find\r\nresp = find()\r\nprint resp.docs\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Roadmap:\r\n\r\n* index updates in JSON format\r\n* moving to **requests** library for handling HTTP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
